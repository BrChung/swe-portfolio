          <p>
            Hello! Iâ€™m Michelle, a software engineer based in Fullerton, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people
            and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should
            develop their professional skills and learn new things all the time.
            Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities to expand my
            horizon.
