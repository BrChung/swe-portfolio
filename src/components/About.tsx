        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Michelle, a software engineer based in Fullerton, CA.</p>
        <p>
          I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and
          adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should develop
          their professional skills and learn new things all the time.
          Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities to expand my
          horizon.
