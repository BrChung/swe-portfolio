  Software Developer Portfolio Starter
</h1>

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # install gatsby-cli via npm
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
    gatsby new swe-portfolio https://github.com/BrChung/swe-portfolio
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd swe-portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `swe-portfolio` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🎨 Colors!

Various shades of these colors were used in the website. The colors can be changed by altering the CSS variables in `/src/styles/global.scss`.

    | Base Colors   | Hex     |
    | ------------- | ------- |
    | Cultured      | #F5F5F5 |
    | Minion Yellow | #FEE348 |
    | Phthalo Blue  | #040F8B |
    | Onyx          | #32373B |

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── .cache
    ├── node_modules
    ├── public
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/.cache`**: _Automatically generated._ This directory contains all the internal cache created automatically by Gatsby. The files inside this folder are not meant for modification.

2.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3.  **`/public`**: _Automatically generated._ This directory contains all static files (hosted by the server) that Gatsby generated. The output of the build process will be exposed inside this folder.

4.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

5.  **`/static`**: This directory contains the files that will be copied to the `public` folder.

6.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

7.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

8.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

9.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

10. **`LICENSE`**: The project is licensed under the MIT license.

11. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

12. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

13. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project. (This file)

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, check out the [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to the Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
